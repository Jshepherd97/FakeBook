# Hackthemidlands 2020 Winning Project - Fakebook - the social media education platform

This project was our winning submission for the Hack the Midlands 2020 Hackathon and was created by Joseph Shepherd and Bolu Edun. 

## What is Fakebook?

Fakebook is a social media education platform for young people, which guides users through social media interactions, teaching and testing them on how to act responsibly online - Access at www.Fakebook.tech

## Inspiration
We were motivated to create a tool that could be used to help educate kids about social media and cybersecurity, in a fun, engaging and contextual way. 

Current cybersecurity education lacks context and is detached from the tools and platforms kids actually use. That is why we wanted to create an interactive, educational experience which looks and feels like a real social media platform. We hope that by doing this, kids will better associate the dangers they are taught about at school with their own experiences.

## What it does
Fakebook is an interactive experience which guides users through some common social media interactions and helps them identify dangers on the platform, asking them what they would do and teaching them how best to respond. In some ways, Fakebook is a test of a user's cybersecurity savviness. Once users have completed their educational journey around the platform, we give them access to the live Fakebook site where they can make posts and see posts made by other Fakebook users.

## How we built it
React.js: Front end, The entire application is built with React, using state hooks and components to make this a single page application with conditional rendering to make elements dynamic and responsive.
HTML/CSS: For webpage structuring and styling, with custom CSS for each individual react component.
Firebase: For hosting and database storage of the live site's posts
